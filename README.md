### RogueOne

My first java based roguelike!
I've built this project using Trystan's tutorial and asciipanel, more of which can be found [here](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html). 

### Overview

Explore procedurally generated rooms and caves while fighting Mutants, Droids and Rogues. You don't know where you are, you don't know 
where you're going but you know you have to get out and find some answers. 

### The Plan

This game doesn't have a core mechanic yet, and is very much a work in progeress. It's more of a tech demo at the moment with a first
official release aimed for the end of the year. Many things are likely to change, including the theme, setting, and engine. This is my
first project of this size, and being a new and aspiring developer, i've learned a lot so far!
