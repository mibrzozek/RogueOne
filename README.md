A small demo of how the game looks :

### Update 11/21/2018

I've replaced the WorldBuilder from Trystans tutorial with PlanetPrinter; my own way of dealing with map generation. After trying to make non linear procedurally generated dungeons, i decided to use the brute force method of building a bunch of rooms on top of eachother. It works, and if it works don't fix it! The maps have large open areas and smaller rooms scattered throughout. I think i'm going to roll with this for now until i have an idea of what type of sophisticated proc dungeons i actually want to make in the future.

So now i have a 5 level dungeons, with large open areas and hidden rooms on each level, and stairs that connect the levels. There needs to be a way to discover hidden rooms. There need to be cool items to find in the rooms. There needs to be difficult but beatable monsters to fight. There needs to be a pool of items the player can start the game with. There need to be a lot of things to make this a true game. 

For now we have a playing field. A place where inseresting events have the potential of taking place. Now it's time to add things to play with! Expect more commits and updates in the future! 

### RogueOne

My first java based roguelike!
I've built this project using Trystan's tutorial and asciipanel, more of which can be found [here](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html).

### Overview

[Explore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyoJRne0Knc) procedurally generated rooms and caves while fighting Mutants, Droids and Rogues. You don't know where you are, you don't know 
where you're going but you know you have to get out and find some answers.

### The Plan

This game doesn't have a core mechanic yet, and is very much a work in progeress. It's more of a tech demo at the moment with a first
official release aimed for the end of the year. Many things are likely to change, including the theme, setting, and engine. This is my
first project of this size, and being a new and aspiring developer, i've learned a lot so far!
